            Design Pro is an innovative event that challenges the creative bug in you. To master
            this event, you need to be a proficient image designer, web developer or animator, any
            one of them. The event is sub-divided into three categories:

            Animax: The ultimate Animation Challenge
            CreatX: The graphic designing contest.
            Webimax: On the spot web development competition.

            You should be able to read it
            - Steve McConnell

            Software development is the versatile equivalent of poetry and prose to engineers. A
            flair for coding, even if a budding one, should be pursued through various
            opportunities. Such an opportunity comes along your way in the form of Envision, a
            software conceptualizing event in TROIKA 2014.

            Envision is a virtual playground, where survival of the deftest prevails. The event
            consists of two categories -

            1. Ingenuity (open coding)
            2. Dexterity (predefined coding)

            These two categories will ensure that the coder isn't left devoid of any finesse that
            he/she has. There is always a need of software innovation in this dynamic technocracy.
            Team TROIKA will guarantee that the people tend to this need and nurture them into the
            adept engineers that they will be."

            Knowledge is a word which you can define in as many ways as you want to. But for us at
            IEEE-DTU, knowledge is what helps you master Ether Avatar.

            Ether Avatar is a LAN quizzing event wherein everyone will be simultaneously attempting
            the quiz by typing in their answers on the computers that we provide at the venue. Ether
            will test your knowledge based on anything and everything under the sun. You can be
            asked questions from Science, Technology, Business, Mythology, Entertainment,
            Literature, Sports, Geography, Heritage, Politics and what not. But itâ€™s not just
            knowledge that you will require. Climbing the Ether ladder requires a combination of
            impeccable presence of mind, quick thinking and perfect ability to connect the dots in
            addition to comprehensive knowledge.

            The bug of curiosity you have been sheltering since time immemorial will be put to test
            when the best of the best quizzers, knowledge enthusiasts and geeks of Delhi and around
            will be pitted against each other in an ever so thrilling encounter.

            So if you think you know A LOT of things about A LOT of things, if you think you can
            crack anything and everything put forward to you from the vast never ending world of
            general knowledge, if you think you have the true quizzing spirit in you, Ether is the
